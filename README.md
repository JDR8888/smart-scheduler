# Description
A smart, adaptive scheduler app that uses jQuery, dayjs, bootstrap, css, html, vanilla JavaScript, local storage, and clever thinking. One can visit the site to see the current date automatically updated and a business-hour grid for listing to-dos, meetings, etc. for each hour-block of time. The scheduler automatically changes the background-color of a given time-block by comparing the hour of the time-block to the current hour - automatically updated for you. Need to come back and check your to-do list or appointments? The scheduler app utilizes local storage so you can easily save whatever you type in for each block in the schedule - it will be waiting for you when you come back to the app later! 
This project is hw assignment #5 for Columbia University's fullstack software dev bootcamp, and features some starter code (most of the html and css) so it is primarily a test of basic JavaScript and related tools like jQuery and dayjs. The project adheres to the following acceptance criteria:

    GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
    WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
    WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    WHEN I click into a timeblock
    THEN I can enter an event
    WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist
